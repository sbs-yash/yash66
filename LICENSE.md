# GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)

## Description
Permissions of this strongest copyleft license are conditioned on making available complete source code of licensed works and modifications, which include larger works using a licensed work, under the same license. Copyright and license notices must be preserved. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights. When a modified version is used to provide a service over a network, the complete source code of the modified version must be made available.

## How to Apply
Create a text file (typically named `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.txt`) in the root of your source code and copy the text of the license into the file.

## Note
The Free Software Foundation recommends taking the additional step of adding a boilerplate notice to the top of each file. The boilerplate can be found at the end of the license.
